# 16. Interview Patterns, Practice, and Q&A

---

## 1. Number Systems & Data Representation

- **Pattern:** Convert numbers between bases, represent negative numbers.
- **Practice:**  
  - Convert 156 to binary, octal, hex.  
  - 2’s complement of -45 (8 bits).  
  - ASCII for “COA”.

---

## 2. Digital Logic

- **Pattern:** Simplify Boolean expressions, design adders/multiplexers.
- **Practice:**  
  - Minimize F(A,B,C) = AB + A’C + BC.  
  - Draw a 4:1 MUX.  
  - Design a 3-bit counter.

---

## 3. Processor Organization

- **Pattern:** Label CPU block diagrams, describe instruction cycle.
- **Practice:**  
  - Draw and explain all CPU registers.  
  - Trace fetch-decode-execute for a simple instruction.

---

## 4. ISA, Addressing, and Instructions

- **Pattern:** Decode instructions, explain addressing modes.
- **Practice:**  
  - Identify addressing mode in `MOV R1, [R2+4]`.  
  - Write instruction cycle steps for `ADD R3, R2, #5`.

---

## 5. Memory Hierarchy

- **Pattern:** Draw hierarchy, explain cache/virtual memory.
- **Practice:**  
  - Calculate cache hit rate for given access pattern.  
  - Draw virtual memory address translation.

---

## 6. I/O & DMA

- **Pattern:** Compare programmed, interrupt, DMA; explain memory-mapped I/O.
- **Practice:**  
  - Draw DMA-based I/O system.  
  - Explain steps for an I/O interrupt.

---

## 7. Pipelining

- **Pattern:** Draw pipeline diagram, identify hazards.
- **Practice:**  
  - Show pipeline execution for instruction sequence.  
  - Resolve data hazards using forwarding.

---

## 8. RISC vs. CISC, Microprogramming

- **Pattern:** Compare architectures, explain microcoded control.
- **Practice:**  
  - List RISC vs. CISC differences.  
  - Write a microprogram for ADD.

---

## 9. Parallelism & Multicore

- **Pattern:** Draw SMP/multicore diagrams, discuss Amdahl’s Law.
- **Practice:**  
  - Calculate speedup for parallel code.  
  - Explain cache coherence.

---

## 10. Performance & Benchmarks

- **Pattern:** Compute CPU time, compare systems.
- **Practice:**  
  - CPU Time = (IC × CPI) / Clock Rate  
  - Analyze SPEC benchmark data.

---

## Behavioral Patterns

- Use diagrams and stepwise explanations.
- Relate real-world analogies (assembly line for pipelining).
- Communicate trade-offs and reasoning.
- Ask clarifying questions if problem statement is broad.

---

## Sample Interview Questions

- What is the difference between RISC and CISC?
- How does cache improve performance?

- What is virtual memory and why is it needed?
- How does DMA differ from interrupt-driven I/O?
- Describe the stages of instruction execution.
- Explain Amdahl’s Law and its significance.
- What are the advantages of multicore architectures?

2. Draw and label a 5-stage instruction pipeline.
3. Design a memory hierarchy diagram including TLB, cache, RAM, and disk.
4. Explain LRU page replacement with an example.
5. Write a microprogram for a simple instruction.
