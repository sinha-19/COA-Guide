# 14. Performance Measurement and Benchmarks

---

## Why Measure Performance?

Performance metrics help compare systems, guide optimizations, and validate architectural choices.

---

## Key Performance Metrics

- **Clock Speed (GHz):** Cycles per second.
- **CPI (Cycles Per Instruction):** Average cycles per instruction.
- **MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second):** Instructions executed per second.
- **MFLOPS (Million Floating Point Operations Per Second):** Floating-point performance.
- **Execution Time:** Time to complete a task.
- **Latency vs. Throughput:** Delay for a task vs. number of tasks per unit time.

---

## Calculating CPU Time

    CPU Time = (Instruction Count) × (CPI) × (Clock Cycle Time)
    or
    CPU Time = (Instruction Count × CPI) / (Clock Rate)

---

## Factors Affecting Performance

- **Instruction Mix:** Different instructions take different cycles.
- **Pipeline Stalls:** Hazards can lower throughput.
- **Cache Misses:** Slow down memory access.
- **Branch Prediction Accuracy:** Reduces control hazards.

---

## Benchmarks

- **Synthetic Benchmarks:** Artificial programs (e.g., Dhrystone, Whetstone).
- **Application Benchmarks:** Real-world programs (SPEC, LINPACK).
- **Microbenchmarks:** Test specific components (cache, memory bandwidth).

---

## Benchmarking Best Practices

- Use relevant workloads.
- Test under comparable conditions.
- Repeat tests and average results.
- Be wary of compiler optimizations and caching effects.

---

## Interpreting Results

- Compare relative performance, not just raw numbers.
- Normalize for instruction count or workload.
- Understand trade-offs: higher clock speed doesn’t always mean faster execution.

---

## Amdahl’s Law in Performance

- Highlights diminishing returns of optimizing single component.
- Focus on optimizing bottlenecks.

---

## Interview Patterns

- Calculate CPU time given instruction count, CPI, and clock rate.
- Analyze benchmark results for two CPUs.
- Explain why MIPS is not always a good metric.
- Compare latency and throughput in real applications.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Relying solely on MIPS or clock speed.
- Ignoring the effect of memory hierarchy.
- Overlooking workload characteristics.

---

## Exercises

1. Compute the CPU time for a program with 1 million instructions, CPI = 2, clock rate = 2GHz.
2. Compare two CPUs using benchmark data.
3. Explain why clock speed alone is not a sufficient measure.
4. Analyze a SPEC benchmark report.
5. Describe how pipeline stalls affect throughput.

---

## Key Interview Questions

- How do you measure CPU performance?
- What is the difference between latency and throughput?
- Why are benchmarks important?
- What is the impact of CPI on performance?
